# StudioWP Google Maps
Easily display a map showing a custom address. 

## Usage
Wherever you want to display an address, just add the following tag
```[google-map address="Fake Street 123, San Fransisco, United States" width="300" height="300"]```.

Possible options so far:
 * __address__ (mandatory): The address to be marked in the map, must include as much details as possible (street, state, country)
 * __width__: The width of the map
 * __height__: The height of the map
 
The plugin will create a div with the class "studiowp-google-map" and place
the map inside it, you can style this div as you want :)
